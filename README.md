create the following tests:
1. Test that the getInventoryCount method returns the inventory.
2. Test for a car being added successfully (did the price of the car get removed from the budget? Was the inventory changed?).
3. Test for a car not being added because there is not enough in the budget.
4. Test for when a car is sold that the money made increases by the price of the car * the dealerMarkUp and that the inventory is updated.
